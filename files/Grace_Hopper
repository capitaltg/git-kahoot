# Grace Hopper

Grace Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral.
One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of
computer programming who invented one of the first linkers. Hopper was the first to
devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages, and the FLOW-MATIC
programming language she created using this theory was later extended to create
COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.
